# Nanotechnology Engineering Workterm Report in LaTeX

This is a LaTeX document class that was written with the intention of making the formatting of NE workterm reports easier.

The class was written by Michal Kononenko, with help from Paulo Miguel.

This class conforms with the new guidelines for NE workterm reports (introduced Fall 2016).

## Why Use LaTeX?

If you have never used LaTeX before, then you should give it a try. LaTeX is a fairly easy to use document preperation system that allows for high quality typesetting. LaTeX is especially useful when writing math equations in line and when dealing with tables and figures. 

The best part of this class is that almost everything is done for you. Take a look at the example workterm report that is included in our package and you'll see how easy LaTeX can be.

You can also find more information on how to use LaTeX online:

## Using the Package

Using the package is extremely easy. The example.tex file has all the commands required to create the sections in the front matter, body and back matter. It also explains the commands required to write math equations, insert figures and automatically generate your back matter.

Most importantly, this class automatically deals with page numbering, the table of contents, the list of figures and the list of figures, allowing you to only need to think about what to write and not how to format it.
